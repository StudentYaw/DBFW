Hello Everyone

Welcome to the DBSFW Code Enjector!
Please enter your codes into the codes.txt file, Make sure its in the same path as the .exe

Make sure the Game and the Code Section is visible on Screen, then run the .exe
It will give you an estimated time for how long its gonna run and then it will do its Magic

If During the run some faulty codes have been detected it will be writen in an extra .txt called codes_with_errors.txt
As of Right now it will Mark already used Codes and Invalid Codes in it.

if you have any other questions hit me up on discord @yaw_
